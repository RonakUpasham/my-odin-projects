            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            Idli is a traditional South Indian breakfast dish made from fermented rice and urad dal batter, 
            which is steamed into soft, round cakes. The idlis are light, fluffy, and mildly tangy, 
            thanks to the fermentation process. Typically served with sambar and coconut chutney, 
            idlis are a healthy and popular choice for a wholesome meal.

            Steps
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium-low heat. 
                Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and chana dal and saute for a few seconds. 
                Add curry leaves, dried red chile, cashews, ginger, green chile peppers, 
                and hing and saute until cashew nuts turn slightly brown, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Add semolina and cook and stir over low heat until slightly browned; remove 
                mixture to a plate and let cool completely, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add yogurt and carrot to the mixture and mix well. Add water as needed to 
                reach desired consistency. Season with salt to taste. Cover and let sit for 
                15 minutes. Check batter consistency again; add more water if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grease an idli pan and add water to steam; bring to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, add fruit salt to the batter, mix well, and then pour the batter in the greased molds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Steam the idli for 10 minutes. Remove the idli from the molds and serve.
